parallax-description-jquery
===========================

A non-trivial use of parallax scrolling.

Check out a live example here: http://rvdm.la/parallax-description-jquery and the source code in index.html from this repository.


WARNING
-------

Right now this code is very poorly written and I do not recommend using it in production. Performance is very poor and so is the code in general. In the very near future I will be making the code performant, portable, packaging it as a jQuery plugin and as an Angular.js directive.

Please feel free to ask me anything on Twitter: @rvdmla
