Parallax Image Description
==========================

A non-trivial use of parallax scrolling.

Check out a live example here: http://rvdm.la/parallax-description-jquery and the source code in index.html from this repository.


WARNING
-------

Right now this code is very poorly written, only works in the latest versions of Chrome and Safari and not at all on touch devices. I do not recommend using it in production. Performance is very poor and so is the code in general. In the very near future I will be making the code performant, portable, clean and package it as a jQuery plugin and as an Angular.js directive. Stay tuned for updates.
